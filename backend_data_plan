For back-end, there are three main data structures: user, thread and message. 
Currently planning to have a database of users and a database of threads.


For user, the contents will be: username, hashed passwords, phone number, and list of threads they are in (this is list of thread ids).
e.g. {username: 'James', phone_number: 09876456345, thread_list:[ 122, 32, 423]}



For thread, the contents will be: thread id, thread name. list of users in thread (usernames), and list of messages in thread 
(message in entirety or a message id?).
e.g. {id: 122, name: 'The boys', messages: 
[{content: {content_text: ‘Pub?’, time: ‘2009-06-15T13:45:30' , location: ‘Welly’}, 
 username: ‘James’, time_sent: ‘2009-06-15T09:45:30’}] }



Messages will contain: content, username of user who sent message, and time message was sent (not sure what format to use).
Content has 3 options, corresponding to ‘Pub?’, ‘Pub’ and ‘Nub’. For message ‘Pub?’ and ‘Pub’, 
there is also a time and a location (stored as a string), so that now content is an object with 3 options:

{content_text: ‘Pub?’, time:[insert_time], location: ‘Pub_name’}
{ content_text: ‘Pub’, time:[insert_time], location: ‘Pub_name’}
{ content_text: ‘Nub’, time: BLANK , location: BLANK}

 So that an example message is {content: {content_text: ‘Pub?’, time: ‘2009-06-15T13:45:30' , location: ‘Welly’}, 
 username: ‘James’, time_sent: ‘2009-06-15T09:45:30’}
