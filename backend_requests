This is discussing all the requests the phone app makes on the servers.
So far requests I can think of are:

1. Create account -
users asks for an account to be made for him, 
Provides: username, phone number and a password. 
Action: new user entered to users database

2. Login to account -
user logins to his account. 
Provides: username, password. 
Action: check against users database, if correct, returns updated messages by users.threads.messages

3. Check messages –
user clicks check messages button. 
Provides: own username. 
Action: return updated messages by users.threads.messages

4. Create thread – 
user clicks create thread. 
Provides: own username, list of username’s what to be in thread. 
Action:go to threads, create new thread, append users. Go to each user, append thread. 
Return messages in thread users.thread.messages (will be blank). 
Return error if username incorrect

5. Add/delete user to thread – 
in a thread, user clicks add/delete user. (can delete himself from thread, ie remove me from thread)
Provides: own username, username to add/delete, thread id. 
Action:go to thread add/remove user, go to user add/remove thread.

6. Post message to thread – 
in thread user posts a message. 
Provides: message.
